## Requirements
- Adobe Character Animator Pro (not the free version) from `creative cloud all applications`\
(requires a [subscription](https://www.adobe.com/de/creativecloud/plans.html), cracks mostly do not work - trust me)
- Python (executable [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

## Setup
